# Sensor_trajectory_plot
The project undertakes an effort to plot a trajectory of path taken using sensor readings along with creating a ground truth. The following codes and files are part of the project as follows:

1. Ground_Truth.ipynb :
  Contains code for the implemntation of ground truth for the actual path taken by the person during the test using the GPS data collected  from the device.
  
2. sensor_data.csv
  Contains data used in the project for the trajectory implmentation and collected during testing.
  
3. sensor_plot.ipynb
  Contains main code for the implementation of the trajectory using the sensor data, with comments on different steps taken during trajectory plotting.
